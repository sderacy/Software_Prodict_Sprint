      <p> Hello! My name is Sterly Deracy. I was born in Miami, Florida and I am Haitian. My entire family came from Haiti
      so I grew up learning Creole. I am not entirely fluent in it because I didn't really speak the language too much as
      as a kid, but I am able to translate most things that are said to me. Since the pandemic, I have been making an earnest
      effort to improve my conversational skills by praciticing it with my mom and other family members. </p>

      <p> I think what definitely makes me me is my love of video games and anime. I grew up playing a lot of games and 
      watching a lot of anime, so these things are naturally what I think of when I want to relax. I have come to love many
      other things, such as coding and playing tennis. I think generally what I like are activities that require me to think
      but also rewards creativity. I am currently a Computer Science major in my 2nd year at the College of New Jersey. Although
      I was born in Florida, I have lived in New Jersey for most of my life, but I have traveled to both Haiti and Florida more
      than once. </p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p> These are the list of projects that I've worked on: </p>
      <ol>
      <li> Bookfinder App </li>
      <ul>
      <li> This app is my current research project. We are currently working on a mobile application help students
      find books in the college library. I've worked on both the front-end and back-end of this project. I spent a lot of
      time working on the user interface because I personally enjoy working on the front-end but I have recently been
      devising a way to optimize the algorithm used to search for the book in the database. It's not an understatement
      to say this has been one of the larger sources of enjoyment of my college experience. Maybe SPS will be a contender!
      </li>
      </ul>
      <li> Montclair Excel Script </li>
      <ul>
      <li> I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy at Montclair...*ahem*. All jokes aside, one of my
      friends from highschool is currently doing research at Montclair and he was complaining about he'd have to go through
      400+ rock samples and manually enter 20+ columns of data. This was over the break and since I love helping others,
      especially my friends, I offered to create a python script that would do this process for him!
      </li>
      </ul>
      <li> ACT Peace Forum </li>
      <ul>
      <li> A teacher from the Math and Science department reached out to the CS department asking to have a website built.
      At the time I was looking for ways to get more experience with website design, so I took up the project and helped
      Dr. Wang create a simple website that would allow him to post blogs related to the coronavirus.
      </li>
      </ul>
      <li> Text Summarizer </li> 
      <ul>
      <li> This one was done during a hackathon. I was a freshman at the time, and I worked with a sophomore and another
      freshman to create a simple Android app that determined the accuracy of one's summary compared to another source of
      text. It was a fun experience and I worked mainly on the front-end part of the app whereas my partners worked on the
      algorithm needed to grade the summarizer. Learning how to scrape websites was super fun! (No it wasn't)
      </li>
      </ul>
      </ol>

      <p> I love photographing things that remind of memories I have with locations I've gone to. For example,
      the leftmost image is me pointing to a bear sign because during this trip in West Virginia to the Cranberry Glades,
      I was concerned with how we were the only people in the park. My friend tried to assure me nothing was wrong until
      I saw red marking on the snow. Obviously bears hibernate but neither of us know where the red marks came from. Could've
      been blood, could've been some juice, but as far as I know we were the only people out there. The image to the right of it
      is me with one of my good friends, and that was my first time being on a cruise ship. Fun story behind that, my friend and
      his father were given some promo where they could bring a 3rd person for a heavily discounted price, so I got to go on my 
      first cruise at an expense that was much much lower than it usually is. I loved it! During that time, we went to the Kennedy
      Space center where I got to see the NASA Vehicle Assembly Building. </p>

      <p>I don't know how this goes for hidden talents, but I do have some photo editing skills. I've started keeping a blog of it
      because I currently have a class where I submit my blogs as an assignment. 
      Here's the <a href = "https://deracyimm110.blogspot.com/">link</a>.</p>
      
      <p> I picked up video editing as a result of web design. There were numerous times where I just needed to edit an image because
          it didn't look quite right, so it made life easier when I could edit the images myself. I'm not some photoshop wiz, but 
          hopefully by the end of this class I'm currently taking, maybe I will be! </p>
